Reload functionality. pdx.reload() enables, and pdx.unreload() disables it.

NOTE: As of pd-lua 0.12.8, this module is now pre-loaded, and pdx.reload()
gets called automatically before running the initialize method of any object,
so calling pdx.reload() explicitly is no longer needed. (Old code importing
the module and doing the call will continue to work, though.) Instead, you
will now have to call pdx.unreload() in your initialize method if you want to
*disable* this feature for some reason.

pdx.reload installs a "pdluax" receiver which reloads the object's script file
when it receives the "reload" message without any arguments, or a "reload
class" message with a matching class name.

Before reloading the script, we also execute the object's prereload() method if
it exists, and the postreload() method after reloading, so that the user can
customize object reinitialization as needed (e.g., to call initialize() after
reloading, or to perform some other custom reinitialization). This was
suggested by @ben-wes (thanks Ben!).

We have to go to some lengths here since we only want the script to be
reloaded *once* for each class, not for every object in the class. This
complicates things quite a bit. In particular, we need to keep track of object
deletions to perform the necessary bookkeeping, in order to ensure that at any
time there's exactly one participating object in the class which receives the
message. Which means that we also need to keep track of the object's finalize
method, so that we can chain to it in our own finalizer.
