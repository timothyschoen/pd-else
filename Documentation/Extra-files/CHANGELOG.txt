1.0-0 Release Candidate 12:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


**LIBRARY:**

Breaking changes:
- [format] outputs are now always symbols, before you could get float outputs. Also, we just have a simplified symbol output, no more lists or anythings. Hopefully I'll be able to get the 'list' output back, but it involved some bugs that I couldn't fix so I just removed it. You cannot use bangs and lists in secondary inlets no more (this is cylone/max bullshit we don't want here). Bang method was actually removed as well.
- [mono] 1st argument is now 'glide' in ms. 
- [sfont~] now uses 'mma' for bank selection (this alters how CC messages set the bank number)
- [player~]/[play.file~] 'open' message does not play files right away anymore.
- [envgen~] removed the 'maxsustain' parameter, use new [gaterelease~] or [gaterelease] objects. Removed the rightmost inlet, now a list input only sets the envelope and doesn't trigger it. Removed set message.
- [dir] open without a symbol now opens a dialog instead of loading the else directory.
- [knob] 'ticks' message is renamed to 'steps' and there is a new 'ticks' message that toggles showing ticks on and off. The 'start' message has been renamed to 'arcstart'. The 'outline' message has been renamed to 'square' for better clarity. Design changed a bit to make it like it is in PlugData (they won), so we now fill the whole background color when in 'square mode' and the knob circle has an 85% proportion when in this case. Now, by default, the GUI is in a new 'loadbang' mode but I don't think this will influence old patches, but I'm afraid that some old patches might behave weird since I added a lot of new stuff. I changed the 'load' message behaviour to not update the object (this can arguably be considered a bug fix).
- [wavetable~], [bl.wavetable~] and [wt2d~]: set message now sets frequencies because of the MC support in [wt~] and [wt2d~], while there's a new 'table' method to set the table name
- [gbman~]/[cusp~] list method is now for MC, old list method is now renamed back to an old 'coeffs' method.
- [f2s~]/[float2sig~] default value is now 10 ms.
- [op] now behvaes like [*~] where the smaller list wraps til reaching the size of the longer one
- [merge]/[unmerge]/[group]: no more '-trim' flag, in [merge] now there's no more 'hot' argument and a bang now represents an empty list and inlets initialized with empty lists 
- [list.seq] does not loop anymore by default
- [pack2] no more support for anythings, also no more support for lists in secondary inlets and output has a list selector (I wanna make this more Pd like and not a silly clone from MAX's pak, cause fuck MAX).
- [resonant~] now has 'q' as the default.
- [resonant2~] has been removed
- [vcf2~] has been renamed to [resonator2~]
- [resonbank~]/[resonbank2~] have basically been deleted and replaced by new objects with the same name - they're now based on [resonator~] and [resonator2~], with a different design.
- [oscbank~] now uses a 'partial' list and not a frequency list, so names/method changed. The freq input now defaults to '1' and this makes [oscbank2~] completely obsolete.
- [oscbank2~] has been deleted.

Enhancements/fixes/other changes:
- [play.file~] added support for more file formats and even weblinks.
- [sfload] added an outlet to output information, added threaded mode, added support for more file formats and even weblinks.
- [sample~], [player~], [gran.player~] and [pvoc.player~] are now also based on [sfload], so they support more file formats.
- [sample~] improve extension management with [file splitext]
- [sample~] and [tabplayer~] now are automatically integrated in a way that [tabplayer~] is always aware of the sample rate of the file loaded in [sample~], so it automatically adjusts the reading speed if it is different that the one Pd is running. 
- [numbox~]'s number display is not preceded by "~" anymore (that was kinda stupid)
- [format] fixed issues where empty symbols and symbols with escaped spaces didn't work. Added support '%a' and '%A' type. Added support for an escaped space flag as well as the apostrophe (') flag. Improved and added support for length modifiers. Improved syntax check which prevents a crash. Improved documentation. 
- [knob] added new 'param', 'var', 'savestate', 'read only', 'loadbang', "active", "reset" and 'ticks' methods. Added the possibility to type in number values and also modes on how to display number values, plus new send symbols for 'activity', 'typing' and 'enter'. New design more like plugdata. Changed some shortcuts to make it simpler and use 'double clicking' (this requires Pd 0.56-0 so it works in GOP).  Yup, a lot of shit here... properties were also significantly improved (I'm finally starting to learn how to deal with tcl/tk).
- [synth~] fixed polyphony bug.
- [metronome~] fixed bug with 'set' message.
- [dir] is now an abstraction based on [file], which gets this out of my back and makes it more portable I hope :) there were some bugs that get fixed with this! Added a mechanism to show just files or just folders. Added new 'show' / 'hide' methods to show you the files/folders from the directory in a 'text' window. A click opens the dialog window to choose the directory. Added a new 'random' message to pick a random possibility from the directory.
- [click] fixed regression bug where it stopped working.
- [else] new 'dir' method to output ELSE's binary directory in a new rightmost outlet (since this functionality was removed from [dir]). The print information also includes the directory.
- [pic] added zoom capability finally (thanks to tim schoen) and added offset message (also thanks to tim).
- [store] added 'sort' functionality.
- [scales] fixed octave number argument. Added functionality to allow octave number as part of the note symbol.
- [mono] added 'glide' parameter, as in [mono~]. 
- [pluck~] fixed list input. 
- [rescale]/[rescale~] added a "reverse log" mode.
- [limit] added a new second ignore mode. 
- [graph~] added an external source input for plotting the graph and a 'clear' message. 
- [canvas.setname], added a new argument for "abstraction mode" and methods to set name, depth (and mode). 
- [midi.learn]  added a new argument for "abstraction mode", fixed 'dirty' message sent to parent. 
- [brickwall~] fixed initialization.
- [list.seq] added a loop mode and a 2nd outlet to send a bang when the sequence is done
- [delete] fixed index for positive numbers
- [dust~] added 'list', 'set' and '-mc' flag for managing Multichannel.
- Tim made improvements to build on rpi/BSD and fixed lots of minor issues.
- Thanks to Tim we have a whole new technique for band limited oscillators; [bl.saw~], [bl.saw2~], [bl.vsaw~], [bl.square~], [bl.tri~], [bl.imp~] and [bl.imp2~] have been redesigned to implement [elliptic blep](https://github.com/Signalsmith-Audio/elliptic-blep), which should provide better anti-aliasing.
- updated to latest [plua].
- [parabolic~] now uses and internal wavetable for more efficiency
- [resonant~] added 'bw' resonance mode.
- [lowpass~]/[highpass~] added 't60' resonance mode.
- [envgen~] fixed a bug (actually a misconception) where ramps started one sample earlier. Added a possibility to set time in samples instead of ms. Maximum number of lines is now 1024
- Added MC support to [gatehold~], [vca.m~], [gain2~], [asr~], [envgen~], [bl.saw~], [bl.saw2~], [bl.vsaw~], [bl.square~], [bl.tri~], [bl.imp~], [bl.imp2~], [imp2~], [tri~], [saw~], [saw2~], [vsaw~], [square~], [pulse~], [parabolic~], [gaussian~], [wavetable~], [wt2d~], [randpulse~], [randpulse2~], [stepnoise~], [rampnoise~] [pink~], [gbamn~], [cusp~], [gray~] and [white~].
- Also added midi input and soft sync to [imp2~], [tri~], [saw~], [saw2~], [vsaw~], [square~], [pulse~], [gaussian~] and [parabolic~].
- [wavetable~ and [wt2d~] gained args to set xfading
- M.E.R.D.A: Added MIDI-LEARN for all modules (this is only for the knobs). Replaced some number boxes that were attached to knobs by an internal number display mechanism (new feature from knob). Improved interface of [gendyn.m~], preset/symbol name fixes to [flanger.m~]. Added MC support to [vca.m~]. Changed some objects to include the new [popmenu] GUI. Added some new modules (see below).
- 16 new objects: [float2imp~], [lace], [delace], [lace~], [delace~], [gatehold], [gaterelease~], [gaterelease], [popmenu], [scope3d~], [tanh~], [resonator~], [sfinfo], [level~] plus [crusher.m~], and [level.m~] MERDA Modules.

1.0-0 Release Candidate 12:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**LIBRARY:**

Breaking changes:
- [oscope~] renamed to [scope~]
- [plaits~] changed inlet order of modulation inputs and some method/flags name. If a MIDI pitch of 0 or less input is given, it becomes a '0hz'.
- [gbman~] changed signal output range, it is now filtered to remove DC and rescaled to a sane -1 to 1 audio range.
- [dust~] and [dust2~] go now up to the sample rate and become white noise (removed restriction that forced actual impulses, that is, no conscutive non zero values)
- [cmul~] object removed (this was only used in the old conv~ abstraction to try and reduce a bit the terrible CPU load)
- [findfile] object removed (use vanilla's [file which] now that it has been updated in Pd 0.55-0)
- [voices] swapped retrig modes 0 and 1, 'voices' renamed to 'n', now it always changes voice number by default as in [poly] (this was already happening unintentionally as a bug when one voice was already taken). The 'split' mode was removed (just use [route], will you?)
- [voices~] was also affected by changes in [voices] of course, such as 'voices' message being renamed to 'n'.
- [sr~]/[nyquist] changed output loading time to 'init' bang
- [sample~] object was significantly redesigned and lots of stuff changed, new messages and flags, added support for 64-bit audio files (Pd 0.55 in double precision and ELSE compiled for 64 bits is required for this). Info outlet now also outputs values for lenght in ms and bit depth.
- [sfont~] uses now a simpler build system and this might not load very very rare and unusual sound formats. 

Enhancements/fixes/other changes:
- builds for double precision is now supposedly supported, by the way, the build system was changed from pd-lib-builder to pd.build by Pierre Guillot.
- [play.file~] is now a compiled object instead of an abstraction thanks to Tim Schoen, and it supports MP3, FLAC, WAV, AIF, AAC, OGG & OPUS file extensions.
- Support for double precision compilation was improved and should be working for all objects (not yet providing binaries and fully tested yet by the way).
- The ELSE binary now loads a modified version of [pdlua], but no [pdlua] and [pdluax] objects are provided. 
- added signal to 2nd inlet of [rm~].
- fixed 'glide' message for [mono~].
- fixed [voices] consistency check bug in rightmost outlet and other minor bugs, added flags for 'n', 'steal' and offset.
- [gain~] and [gain2~] changed learn/forget shortcut
- [knob] fixed sending messages to 'empty' when it shouldn't, ignore nan/inf, prevent a tcl/tk error if lower and upper values are the same; added "learn/forget" messages and shortcut for a midi learn mechanism.
- [mpe.in] now outputs port number and you can select which port to listen to.
- Other MIDI in objects now deal with port number encoded to channel as native Pd objects. Objects affected are [midi.learn], [midi.in], [note.in], [ctl.in], [bend.in], [pgm.in], [touch.in] and [ptouch.in].
- [pi]/[e] now takes a value name argument.
- [sr~]/[nyquist~] take clicks now and a value name argument.

- [plaits~] added a new 'transp' message and a functionality to allow MIDI input to supersede signal connections (needed for the 'merda' version [see below]), fixed MIDI velocity.
- [pluck~] added a new functionality to allow MIDI input to supersede signal connections (needed for the 'merda' version [see below]).
- 26 new objects, [velvet~], [vcf2~], [damp.osc~], [sfload], [pdlink] and [pdlink~], plus abstractions from a newly included submodule called "Modular Euro Racks Dancing Along" (M.E.R.D.A)! Warning, this is all just very very experimental still, the object are: [adsr.m~], [brane.m~], [chorus.m~], [delay.m~], [drive.m~], [flanger.m~], [gendyn.m~], [lfo.m~], [phaser.m~], [plaits.m~], [plate.rev.m~], [pluck.m~], [pm6.m~], [presets.m], [rm.m~], [seq8.m~], [sig.m~], [vca.m~], [vcf.m~] and [vco.m~] (6 of these are multichannel aware).

- [bicoeff] renamed to [bicoeff2] since [bicoeff] is now a new GUI object.
- Replaced some band limited oscillators abstractions for compiled objects that are backwards compatible, more efficient, but hey, they sound different and produce different waveforms. They are: [bl.tri~], [bl.square~], [bl.saw~], [bl.saw2~] and [bl.vsaw~].
- [sysrt.out] added new 2nd "tick" outlet.
- rint/floor/ceil: removed 2nd inlet and bang/set methods
- free.rev~: decay parameter is now mapped differently internally
- Objects with random number generators now have a unique seed based on system time, this is more of an improvement than a breaking change. The pseudo random generator algorithm has also been unified. Now all objects have a 'seed' method and a seed flag. I lost track which objects break in this change. Some objects did not even have this and now have. These objects are: brown, brown~, chance, chance~, drunkard, drunkard~, dust~, dust2~, gray~, lfnoise, lfnoise~, markov, perlin, pink~, rampnoise, rampnoise~, rand.f, rand.f~, rand.i, rand.i~, rand.list, rand.seq, randpulse, randpulse~, randpulse2, randpulse~, stepnoise, stepnoise~, tempo, tempo~, white~

Enhancements/fixes:
- [eqdiv] fixed resolution issue.
- fixed memory crash in [args].
- fixed [shaper~] freezing pd on windows.
- [pluck~] added float and bang method for control triggering. Changed internal filter to a 1 pole filter (this is like the new [lop2~] object and arguably another breaking change). General efficiency improved.

1.0-0 Release Candidate 1:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

LIBRARY:
---------

Breaking changes:
- FLAGS now should come first!!! This was a major issue in ELSE, where it allows flags after arguments and this is not how flags work in Pd Vanilla, so this has finally been fixed but it breaks the majority of the following affected objects: count, grain.live~, grain.sampler~, grain.synth~, gran.player~, pvoc.player~, bpbank~, oscbank~, oscbank2~, resonbank~, resonbank2~, function~, envgen~, sample~, rec.file~, play.file~, player~, adsr~, asr~, allpass.2nd~, autotune, bandpass~, bandstop~, bend.in/out, cents2frac, chance, clock, comb.filt~, dec2frac, deg2rad, del~, dir, drive~, drunkard/drunkard~, duck~, envelope~, eq~, fbdelay~, ffdelay~, flanger~, glide / glide2 /  glide~ / glide2~, group, highpass~, impulse, interpolate, iterate, lfo, lb, loop, lowpass~, merge, metronome, midi, mono, morph, mov.avg~, mov.rms~, noisegate~, norm~, note.in, note.out, openfile, out1~, pattern, phasor, peak~, pimp, pitch2note, pluck~, presets, pulse, quantizer/quantizer~, rad2deg, ramp~, rescale / rescale~, resonant~, retune, rms~, scales, sh~, shaper~, s2f~, slew / slew2, suspedal, tabplayer~, tabwriter~, touch.in, touch.out, unmerge, voices, xmod~, vocoder~

- [function~]/[envgen~]: '-exp' flag/message is now different and a new 'expl' message has the old behaviour.
- [tempo]/[tempo~]: 'div' parameter renamed to 'mul' (which does not affect immediately in [tempo~] anymore but waits the next bang as in [metro]). No more 'mode' settings in [tempo] and now the default mode is "immediate". These changes make the objects consistent to each other and to other objects in ELSE. 
- [oscilloscope~]: renamed to [oscope~].
- [trigger2]: object removed.
- [pimp]: default grain is 5ms, resetting phase to 0/1 doesn't bang anymore.
- [metronome]: new design with different outlets.
- [clock]: multiplier parameter is an actual frequency multiplier instead of divider (so it's the opposite now, where '2' is twice as fast instead of twice as slow; this is better for tuplets/polyrhythms by the way).

1.0-0 beta 34

Breaking changes:
- [tabplayer~]: changed the purpose of 'start' message, a new 'play' message handles what start did.
- [player~] also has some method changes like 'play' instead of start (and is now based on tabplayer~).
- [lfo] vsaw now has width from 0 to 1 as vsaw~

Changes:
- [note] has 'Menlo' as the default font for mac, since this is the default font for mac in Pd in 0.51-3

- 1 new object for a total of 380: [combine] 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0-0 beta 32


Breaking changes:
- [note]: changed some method/flag names.
- [separate]: now elements that look like floats are converted to floats / separator method has been removed in favor of a secondary inlet (this now makes it compliant to a new counterpart object named [unite]).
- [colors]: you must now specify "iemgui" instead of "gui", and default output is now 'hexadecimal'
- [else]: now it won't add else's path anymore to preference's path, so you must now load else via preferences => path or [declare -path else]. You can still load else in startup to print the library version.

Improvements/fixes:
- Fixed issues that prevented ELSE from being compiled inside Camomile (which turns pd patches into plugins). 
- Lots of random objects now have a unique seed value based on system time. Objects affected: rand.f/rand.f~/rand.i/rand.i~/rampnoise/rampnoise~/stepnoise/stepnoise~/lfnoise/lfnoise~.
- [drum.seq]: fixed embedding sequence values. 
- [note]: several new methods and graphical improvements as well as a properties window (this is basically stolen from cyclone's comment). Improved GOP, fixed loading receive symbol arg without making Pd asking to save changes. 
- [separate]: added an "empty" separator that separates all characters from the symbol. 
- virtually all abstractions: now it's possible to create them and load them correctly via dynamic patching. 
- improved GOP visibility for GUI objects: keyboard, pad, button & function. 
- [canvas.edit]/[canvas.zoom]/[fontsize]: added a a bang method to query for status. 
- [spectrograph~]: added a hann window and fixed a bug related to setting parameters via messages and also another bug with the -db and -log flags. Added a rate parameter and the possibility to graph via bangs.

- [canvas.edit]: now also detects getting into edit mode via "select all" (also true for compiled GUI objects that react to getting in and out of edit mode: keyboard/pad/pic/function/button). 
- 3 new objects for a total of 379: [unite], [symbol2any] and [oscilloscope~] (basically stolen from cyclone).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0-0 beta 31

Breaking changes:
- [xgate~] & [xselect~]: Removed linear crossfade option, instead of adding this option to all the other objects that were similar, it was decided just not to support this option, as it doesn't seem the best option.
- [rec~] renamed to [tabwriter~], so it's related to [tabwrite~] and [tabplayer~]. Design has changed as well.

Non breaking changes:
- [mono.rev~] and [stereo.rev~]: Default wet values is now "0.5". 
- [rec.file~]: minimum fade is now 0 ms. 
- [pvoc.live~]: 1st buffer size argument is not obligatory anymore, default is 5000ms. 
- [stretch.shift~~]: 1st argument default is now 5000ms like in [pvoc.live~]. 

Improvements/fixes:
- [else]: fixed Pd version check (minimum should have been 0.51-1, not 0.51-0). 
- [tempo] & [tempo~]: added 'hz' time measure and messages with more than one item (like 'ms 100') now sets other parameters. 
- [function]: improvements on drawing instructions, don't draw if it should not be visible. Now inlet/outlets are only shown if in edit mode and if no send/receive symbol are given.
- [tabplayer~]: fixed -loop flag. 
- [slider2d]: init message fixed. 
- [circle] & [slider2d]: Now these can be used in a GOP (Graph On Parent) buried more than one level of depth (this means it can be used anywhere) - this is thanks to a new implementation based on the new [pad] object. 
- [button]: this is now a compiled object and can now be used inside GOP (in any depth level). You can set colors and different dimension sizes for x/y axis. 
- 3 new objects for a total of 376: [pad], [perlin~] and [batch.write~].

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0-0 beta 30

Breaking changes:
- [dollarzero] renamed to [dollsym] as the name was just plain wrong as it also expands any dollar sign symbols (bang method was also removed).
- [messbox]: clear message remove, just use 'set' instead.
- [rec.file~]: leftmost inlet now takes control messages, this makes it more compliant to other similar objects in the library (as [rec~] and [autofade~]).

Improvements/fixes:
- [else]: fixed version checking (it would complain if you upgrade to newer versions of Pd)
- [sample~]: fixed loading arguments
- [play.file~] and [sample]: fixed a bug where they couldn't load files that didn't exist by the time they were created.
- [display] now resizes better for non-fixed size setting with characters like "ç" and "ã", but still doesn't work well for other foreign alphabets like katakana and stuff. Instead of an abstraction, I should probably write an actual GUI compiled external for this and [display~] soonish.
- 3 new objects for a total of 372: [batch.rec~], [tabplayer~] and [fontsize] 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0-0 beta 29

Breaking changes:
- deleted [fromany] and [toany] objects. These were requested by Liam Goodrace for his "Context Sequencer", but not even him can tell me anymore why this is/was needed. I think it's obsolete and unnecessary and offer no real substantial advantage to [list from/tosymbol]. If anyone actually needed this for any reason, let me know...  
- [keyboard] - behaviour changed a bit: now, by default, the velocity value depends on where you click on the vertical axis. You can set a normalized value if you want.
- [pic] deleted 'bang' method.
- [makesymbol] renamed to [format] and behaviour also changed: now it outputs anythings instead of symbols, bang method was removed from secondary inlets, variable arguments are mandatory for the object to output values (errors are given otherwise). You can still generate symbols as [makesymbol] used to (see help file for details).
- [drum.seq] the 'export' message now outputs a list preceded by "export", which shall avoid issues and make it easier to manage/route.

Improvements/fixes:
- [dir]: now you can open absolute paths in windows, which was never possible before (yikes).
- keyboard: Now velocities can be set depending where you click, there's a normalization method, and you can also toggle keys by pressing "shift". Also added send/receive symbols, and inlets/outlet are drawn when in edit mode. Now we have a checkbutton (toggle) in the properties where pertinent. You should also now use flags instead of arguments. There are also many improvements to the code and other minor fixes. 
- [pic]: Fixed a bug in the properties window where you couldn't set "report size". Improved management of special characters in properties window (now you don't need to escape them anymore, for instance). Now we have a checkbutton (toggle) in the properties where pertinent, plus other minor improvements to the code.
- [any2symbol] added new inlet/argument to set a new separator character.
- [drunkard~]: added secondary inlets to set lower and upper bounds.
- [routeall] fixed/improved routing for anythings.
- 1 new object for a total of 370: [messbox] 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0-0 beta 28

Breaking changes:
- With the new feature of inlet~ where it can take control messages (as of Pd 0.51), several objects had their inlet messages changed. 29 objects affected: [bin.shift~], [bpbank], [compress~], [conv~], [drunkard~], [duck~], [free.rev~], [freeze~], [gain~], [gain2~], [graph~], [mix2~], [mix4~], [mono.rev~], [oscbank~], [out~], [out1~], [out4~], [out8~], [phaser~], [plate.rev~], [pvoc.freeze~], [pvoc.live~], [resonbank~], [resonbank2~], [spectrograph~], [stereo.rev~], [stretch.shift~] & [vocoder~] 
- [savechange] object deleted (using something based on [canvas.setname] for what that other object did now).


Improvements/fixes:
- The ELSE library now is accompanied by the Live Electronics Tutorial by Alexandre Torres Porres as a single download combo.
- The ELSE library now should be loaded as a binary pack because of a new "else" binary. This allows the ELSE library to be loaded as a regular lib, via Startup, or using [declare -lib else]. The binary can also be loaded as an object, which outputs version and information about the library.
- With the new feature of inlet~ where it can take arguments, several objects got improvements. 11 objects affected: [allpass.filt~], [bl.imp~], [bl.imp2~], [bl.saw~], [bl.saw2~], [bl.sine~], [bl.square~], [bl.tri~], [bl.vsaw~], [bl.wavetable~] & [crusher~].
- [keyboard]: many improvements to the code (basically a rewrite from scratch). Implemented zooming. Finally implemented the toggle mode and added a flush message. Improved/fixed the way it was detecting the click on the right keys. Fixed clicking in Graph on Parent. Now the object asks you if you want to save changes after changing parameters from messages, plus other minor fixes.
- [slider2d] and [cricle] are now usable in an abstraction or GOP subpatch, but only as deep as only one layer of encapsulation.
- [avg]: fixed "clear" message.
- [nyquist~]: wasn't creating in linux.
- [graph~]: added an outlet for the input signal come out to.
- [dir]: fixed a bug where it printed an annoying error on windows.

- [pic]: added "set" and "size" methods - included an example on how to use [canvas.zoom] for emulating a zoom.
- fixed peak estimation for [peak~], [vu~], [meter~], [meter2~], [meter4~] and [meter8~].
- Now [spectrograph~], [graph~], [range.hsl], [drum.seq], [mtx.ctl] and [button] will properly ask if you want to save changes on parent patch.
- 6 new objects for a total of 371: [else], [canvas.bounds], [canvas.pos], [canvas.gop], [canvas.zoom] & [canvas.setname].

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- added ZOOM support for [canvas.mouse], also added zero and reset methods. Fixed the output order of outlets!
- [slider2d] and [circle]: improved efficiency by including the [limit] object. Fixed the way [savechange] was being used. Because of the ZOOM support in [canvas.mouse], these objects also now work properly in ZOOM mode!
- [circle]: improved mouse interaction, added bgcolor and 'no-clip' mode.
- [range.hsl]: improved a bit; management when in ZOOM (still has known issues).
- [function] & [note]: added 'dirty' flag for when things changed so it asks you if you wanna save it.
- [function]: Implemented ZOOM capability! Fixed outline color of dots to foreground's (it was always black), fixed a bug where setting receive name repeatedly made the object disappear.
- [pic]: fixed and improved many things, the image now is properly adjusted to the objects's coordinate; object now asks if you want to save changes; now clicking on it sends a bang; added send/receive symbols; added outline mode; now when you're in edit mode you can see an outline and the inlet/outlet; Implemented ZOOM capability (but this doesn't mean the picture gets zoomed); there's also a handy properties windows now! 
- 2 new objects for a total of 366 (228 signal and 138 control objects): [canvas.edit], [canvas.vis]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0-0 beta 26

Breaking changes:
- [slider2d] has a new argument order because it now includes an independent x/y size. By default it doesn't work with jump on click but a new steady mode.
- [canvas.mouse] is now not responsive while in 'edit mode' ([mouse] still is)
- [window] renamed to [canvas.active]

Improvements/fixes:
- [slider2d]: included send/receive names, independent x/y sizes, an option to hide coordinate lines, a grid option, colors for background and foreground, an 'init' option, a steady mode (default [jump on click now setable]), shift key now offers fine tuning, new [savechange] object offers a better management of saving changes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0-0 beta 22

Breaking changes:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0-0 beta 21

Breaking changes:
- [loop] - the 2nd outlet was removed (painful change, but I got convinced that just using trigger to send a bang after the loop is finished is a better design choice).

Improvements/fixes:
- [loop] - new float inlet set number of iterations. 
- [mtx.ctl] - New import/export/flush methods. Improvements under the hood. It can now keep/save its parameters as regular GUIs do. A new embed method saves the contents within the object.
